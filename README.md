# ToWatch Client App

This is an excuse to learn Relay, GraphQL and Aphrodite.

Generated with Create React App.

## Goal

To be able to search for an save films and TV shows to a watchlist. To do this
I'll create a GraphQL server that returns films against a search API and returns
a list of saved items to watch.
